# Algorithms Design and Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for the *Algorithms Design and Analysis* course, showcasing my practice and implementation of various algorithmic concepts and graph-based algorithms studied in university.

## Overview

This course dives into the foundations of algorithm design, complexity analysis, and efficient problem-solving techniques. Here, I document my understanding and implementation of key algorithms covered in the curriculum.

## Contents

### Graph Algorithms

The repository includes implementations and notes on the following topics in graph theory:

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Techniques to find the smallest path between nodes in a graph.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A recursive approach to explore all vertices and edges in a graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An iterative method to traverse a graph level by level.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Algorithms to find the minimum-cost tree that connects all nodes in a graph.

### Other Topics (Coming Soon)

- Additional algorithms related to sorting, searching, and optimization problems.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented with code comments to clarify steps and logic. You can clone the repository and explore individual files within each topic folder to run the code and see examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alnobanideveloper/PSUT-ALGO.git
